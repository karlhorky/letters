# How to contribute

This is a very strange little project. I hope you'll understand, therefore, that the contributing guidelines are a little dogmatic.

These are a collection of letters that I write to a specific person. Thus, they're not like code that can necessarily be improved. That said, I spell things wrong. I mess up grammar. You know, normal human stuff. Submitting PRs with corrections for these things is always much appreciated because even though I try my best to correct these things sometimes errors fall through the cracks anyway.

I don't accept PRs with new letters; I hope you'll understand, as per above, that these are just letters I'm writing to someone about how I feel when I'm traveling, or sad, or silly, or stupid. As the rules of the universe have dictated that you are not me in a cosmic sense (depending on your own views on matter, soul, religion, etc.) I thus don't accept PRs with your letters. That said:

# Forking

If, for you, like me, this sort of thing would be beneficial, please fork it. Write your own letters. Write them to someone, write them to no one, write them when sad, write them when healthy, write them when happy, write them. That's the lovely thing about lettes; you put the postage on them, mail them, and then they're not really yours anymore; the thoughts that weighed you down and or upset you or clogged up space in your brain just aren't there anymore. You're light as a feather, sometimes, just knowing that they're beyond your control. Out there in space, where you can no longer touch them.
