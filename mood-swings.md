Dearest,

Some days, I feel great. Or I start off okay and go to bad and then to great because I accomplish something. Normally it is a very small thing. Or I accomplish nothing, and feel bad. Today I finished something, and was perhaps unfairly congratulatory of myself.

It’s a little intimidating how fragile moods are. Like that time you were so angry when we got home that one time and couldn’t figure out how to make yourself feel better until you decided on a whim to cut off all of your hair and for some reason it worked. I’m really glad it did. I never feel more useless than in the face of our brains turning their guns on us.

As always,
