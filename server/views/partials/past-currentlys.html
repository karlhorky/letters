  <p id="past-currentlys-text">“Currently”s are collections of images and thoughts that speak to me at the moment. Sometimes, they’re just quotes and images I’ve curated; other times, I talk to you and show a few snapshots of my life at the moment. <a id="past-currentlys">See past currentlys</a>.</p>
