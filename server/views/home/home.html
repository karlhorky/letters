      <h1>Helen V. Holmes</h1>
      <p>is a designer working happily out of her small home office in her small town home. She’s had the privilege of working with brands such as <a href="https://www.capitalone.com/" target="_blank">Capital One</a>, <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/" target="_blank">Mozilla Firefox</a>, and <a href="https://hagersharp.com/" target="_blank">Hager Sharp</a>. She’s given talks at <a href="/speaking">design, web, and iOS conferences around the world</a> about how design and code can come together to build really beautiful experiences. When she’s not researching or writing about the design and the web, she <a href="/writing">writes</a>.</p>
