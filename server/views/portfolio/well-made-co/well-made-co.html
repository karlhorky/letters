          <p>This project was all about how to reinvent packaging for the better. How can packaging be good for the environment? Well, by making it reuseable, I thought. The details were what made this fun for me; if we'd done superlatives in college I think this would have gotten me 'most crafty'. </p>

      <p>This project was fun and yet <em>so </em> challenging. The tag I wanted to double as a star map, so I had to carefully cut out thin lines with an exacto, glue them down, and then layer glow-in-the-dark paint to make it pop in the darkness. (This is of course ignoring doing the die cut bear myself, which was challenging as wellâ€”I had to layer cardstock as I couldn't have gotten the fidelity I wanted by hand with anything thicker). The map tube and bag felt easy by comparison, but both still necessitated from acrobatics with gluging and ironing.</p>
