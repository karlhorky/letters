          <p>Our professor looks at us and says, <em>Choose a company to rebrand, and make it a huge company. Go big. </em>Of course I turn around and choose an airline monolith, which was the most <em>reasonable </em>of all my choices at that.

What would truly making flying with United a more pleasant experience, an easier one, a safer one? The answer, I felt, was in clear, concise information: the ability at a glance to understand the trifecta of information that is always at play when flying: your flight information, your rental car information, and your hotel information.
