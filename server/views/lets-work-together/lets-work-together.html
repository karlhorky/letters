    <section class="about-me">
      <p>I run my own design contracting company named Helen V. Holmes LLC. I specialize in experience and interaction design—specifically web, native, and hardware experiences. I am often a liason between designers and developers, and enjoy writing and speaking about how designers and developers can work together to build great experiences. I’ve worked both as a designer and as an engineer, and find I’m well-suited to this challenging interim space.</p>

      <p>If you think I’d be a good fit for your team, I encourage you to check out my case studies below to double-check. If you’re already convinced (wow, hello, yay!), please <a href="mailto:helen.v.holmes@gmail.com">shoot me an email</a> for my resume and references.</p>

      <p>I’ve done a small amount of public speaking—and looking at the body of my work, you’ll find that most of it is about figuring out how to make design concerns and engineering concerns play nice, with a small bit of human advice thrown in.</p>

      <h2 class="avenir-headers">Capital One</h2>
      <p>The 9-to-5 work I did at Capital One was NDA’d. (<em>Yawn.</em>) What I can say is that I helped develop a number of internal components and a <a href="https://github.com/helenvholmes/gulp-starter" target="_blank">Gulp boilerplate</a> that was widely used by the front end engineers on the design team. I also cofounded the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Women-Who-Code-DC/" target="_blank">Women Who Code DC chapter</a> and or mentored at numerous student hackathons all over the country.</p>

      <p>I also made a ton of React forms. It was just endless.</p>

    <div class="portfolio-copy">
      <p>My senior portfolio review to graduate university was somewhat terrifying—to help paint a picture: It is 7am in the morning. You have been awake for three days straight and have driven back and forth to your home in your mother’s basement to get crafting supplies through a storm storm. The projects included in this presentation—which are this point, you’ll feel glad just to complete—are a mysterious blackbox that hold the key to you getting a diploma. You’re bundling it all up. It contains a <a href="/portfolio/game-of-thrones">series of book covers for a popular fantasy series</a>, a <a href="/portfolio/united">rebranding for a famous airline</a>, a <a href="/portfolio/well-made-co">packaging project</a>, and your <a href="/portfolio/winsome">first attempt at building a complete web app</a>.</p>

      <p>It represents what you can do under pressure and years later you’re still proud of it. You tell yourself it looks pretty okay, because the alternative is complete insanity.</p>
