Most Angular animations work by appending and removing CSS classes, which means that ```transitions``` don't work for shit. (Not entirely true; they'll work, but only on second fire. Annoying.) According to this [SO post]() it might be because the browser doesn't have the chance to render it fast enough, as if it isn't aware of its initial state beforehand. Idk, friends.

If you need/want to have a nice fade in on enter, you need to do it with keyframes. Always, essentially.
