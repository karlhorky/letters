**Important Note: I’m working on a Mac, so this will all be Mac-specific.**

The command line is fastest way to get around your computer and the secret portal to tools that will level-up your web-design coding skills: [git](http://git-scm.com), [sass](http://sass-lang.com), [grunt](http://gruntjs.com), [yeoman](http://yeoman.io), [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), just to name a few. I’m no Unix-expert but the terminal is now the first thing I open when my computer opens because once you’ve learned the commands you need you’ll get around _so much faster_ when coding. Trust me.

Hit CMD+Space and type ’Terminal’. Let’s get started:

![]({{ site.url }}/images/terminal.jpg)

When you open your terminal, you see a few things: the name of your computer, the folder you’re in, and possibly the date. You always start out in the _Home_ directory, which is equivalent to this directory in Finder:

![]({{ site.url }}/images/home-directory.jpg)

To see the contents of a directory, type `ls -l`:

![]({{ site.url }}/images/home-contents.jpg)

I have a ton of stuff in mine, and you probably do too. Often times there are a lot of hidden files and folders in this directory, which you can see in the terminal (but cannot in Finder).

You can make folders (directories) and files from the terminal pretty easily. Let’s make one now called `code`:

    mkdir code

This is just a short way of saying ’make directory’. If you do another `ls -l`, you’ll see that we now have a directory called `code`:

![]({{ site.url }}/images/home-contents-code.jpg)

To change folders, you type `cd` - short for change directories. Let’s move into the `code` directory:

    cd code

The terminal is intelligent. If you type `cd c` and then hit `TAB`, it will move you into the directory that starts with `c` or give you a few options for you to pick from. When I open my terminal, I always type `cd c` + `TAB` + `<name of project>` and get to the folder I want to be really quickly.

Now that we’re in `code` let’s make a file. Let's set up some files for a web project:

    touch index.html

This will make a new, empty file called `index.html`. Nice! Let's make folders and such like we just learned:

    mkdir css
    mkdir js
    touch page.html
    touch post.html

You can see all of these things with the `ls -l` command from before:

![]({{ site.url }}/images/blog-contents.jpg)

Awesome, but having all of our files in our ’code’ folder isn't very helpful. They need a project folder. Let's put them in a folder called ’blog’:

    mkdir blog && mv * blog

There were three things in that line of code you haven't seen before, so let’s break it down:

`mkdir blog`: this you’ve done before. We’re making a directory called `blog`.

`&&`: this is command-line-speak for ’and’. So, ’do this and then do this’.

`mv`: this is short for _move_. Move the files.

`*`: this is a selector that means ’everything’. We could have moved every item one-by-one, but that would have been annoying.

`blog`: this is the target directory where we're moving everything, i.e. the folder we just made.

Now, when you do `ls -l` you should just see one folder:

![]({{ site.url }}/images/blog.jpg)

Let's change into the blog directory:

    `cd blog`

We just learned the `mv` command. You can use the `mv` command to rename files too. Let’s do it now:

    mv page.html about.html

If yo do another `ls -l`, you’ll see we now have an `about.html` file instead of `page.html`.

We’ve decided that we don't want `about.html` at all. Let’s delete it. However, before we do, we should probably really analyze whether or not we want to: deleting something from the command line is like sending it to the Trash Can and emptying it in one fell swoop.

    rm about.html

`rm` is short for _remove_. Let’s go up a directory and delete the entire folder:

    cd ..
    rm -rf blog/

`..` is how you go up one directory. The `-rf` is necessary for doing anything to a folder (copying, deleting, moving) from the command line. If you’re familiar with programming basics, it means that we’re doing the action _recursively_.

Now that we’re in `code`, let’s make a new directory called `webapp`. We’re going to copy to our Desktop next:

    mkdir webapp

You can get to the Desktop (and anywhere else) from the ’code’ directory like this:

    cd ~/Desktop

Remember our _home_ directory from the very beginning? You can access that directory from any folder anywhere by `cd ~`.

    cp -rf /code/webapp /Desktop/webapp

`cp` stands for _copy_. Since we're copying a folder, we need to put the `-rf`.

---------------

That's it for _Intro to the Command Line_. None of it is particularly complicated, it's just a matter of learning the commands and using them regularly. Learning the command line for me was how I started learning sass, git, grunt, and lots of other tools that took my web design to the next level. The next up in our series is _Intro to Git_, an essential if you write code... _ever_. Not exaggerating.

[Joni Trythall](http://jonibologna.com/command-line-primer-primer/) did a write-up on this too that I like and is worth looking over if you high-level reasoning for why the command line's great.

If you've been working with the command line and are annoying that you can click and type, there are [commands for that](http://cmd.club/)! I have these [bash stickers](http://cmd.club/) that are pretty rad.
