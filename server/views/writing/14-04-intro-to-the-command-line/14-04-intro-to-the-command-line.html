    <strong>Important Note: I’m working on a Mac, so this will all be Mac-specific.</strong>

    <p>The command line is fastest way to get around your computer and the secret portal to tools that will level-up your web-design coding skills: <a href="http://git-scm.com" target="_blank">git</a>, <a href="http://sass-lang.com" target="_blank">sass</a>, <a href="http://gruntjs.com" target="_blank">grunt</a>, <a href="http://yeoman.io">yeoman</a>, <a href="http://jekyllrb.com" target="_blank">jekyll</a>, just to name a few. I’m no Unix-expert but the terminal is now the first thing I open when my computer opens because once you’ve learned the commands you need you’ll get around <em>so much faster</em> when coding. Trust me.</p>

    <p>Hit CMD+Space and type <code>Terminal</code>. Let’s get started:</p>

    <p>When you open your terminal, you see a few things: the name of your computer, the folder you’re in, and possibly the date. You always start out in the <em>Home</em> directory, which is equivalent to the "home" directory in Finder.</p>

    <p>To see the contents of a directory, type <code>ls -l</code>.</p>

    <p>I have a ton of stuff in mine, and you probably do too. Often times there are a lot of hidden files and folders in this directory, which you can see in the terminal (but cannot in Finder).</p>

    <p>You can make folders (directories) and files from the terminal pretty easily. Let’s make one now called <code>code</code>.</p>

    <code>
      mkdir code
    </code>

    <p>This is just a short way of saying ’make directory’. If you do another <code>ls -l</code>, you’ll see that we now have a directory called <code>code</code>.</p>

    <p>To change folders, you type <code>cd</code> - short for change directories. Let’s move into the <code>code</code> directory:</p>

    <code>
      cd code
    </code>

    <p>The terminal is intelligent. If you type `cd c` and then hit <code>TAB</code>, it will move you into the directory that starts with <code>c</code> or give you a few options for you to pick from. When I open my terminal, I always type <code>cd code</code> + <code>TAB</code> + <code><name of project></code> and get to the folder I want to be really quickly.</p>

    <p>Now that we’re in <code>code</code> let’s make a file. Let's set up some files for a web project:</p>

    <code>
      touch index.html
    </code>

    <p>This will make a new, empty file called <code>index.html</code>. Nice! Let's make folders and such like we just learned:</p>

    <code>
      mkdir css
      mkdir js
      touch page.html
      touch post.html
    </code>

    <p>You can see all of these things with the <code>ls -l</code> command from before.</p>

    <p>Awesome, but having all of our files in our <code>code</code> folder isn't very helpful. They need a project folder. Let's put them in a folder called <code>blog</code>:</p>

    <code>
      mkdir blog && mv * blog
    </code>

    <p>There were three things in that line of code you haven't seen before, so let’s break it down:</p>

    <p><code>mkdir blog</code>: this you’ve done before. We’re making a directory called <code>blog</code>.</p>

    <p><code>&&</code>: this is command-line-speak for ’and’. So, ’do this and then do this’.</p>

    <p><code>mv</code>: this is short for <em>move</em>. Move the files.</p>

    <p><code>*</code>: this is a selector that means ’everything’. We could have moved every item one-by-one, but that would have been annoying.</p>

    <p><code>blog</code>: this is the target directory where we're moving everything, i.e. the folder we just made.</p>

    <p>Now, when you do <code>ls -l</code> you should just see one folder.</p>

    <p>Let's change into the blog directory:</p>

    <code>
      cd blog
    </code>

    <p>We just learned the <code>mv</code> command. You can use the <code>mv</code> command to rename files too. Let’s do it now:</p>

    <code>
      mv page.html about.html
    </code>

    <p>If yo do another <code>ls -l</code>, you’ll see we now have an <code>about.html</code> file instead of <code>page.html</code>.</p>

    <p>We’ve decided that we don't want <code>about.html</code> at all. Let’s delete it. However, before we do, we should probably really analyze whether or not we want to: deleting something from the command line is like sending it to the Trash Can and emptying it in one fell swoop.</p>

    <code>
        rm about.html
    </code>

    <p><code>rm</code> is short fo</p>r <em>remove</em>. Let’s go up a directory and delete the entire folder:

    <code>
        cd ..
        rm -rf blog/
    </code>

    <p><code>..</code> is how you go up one directory. The <code>-rf</code> is necessary for doing anything to a folder (copying, deleting, moving) from the command line. If you’re familiar with programming basics, it means that we’re doing the action <em>recursively</em>.</p>

    <p>Now that we’re in <code>code</code>, let’s make a new directory called <code>webapp</code>. We’re going to copy to our Desktop next:</p>

    <code>
        mkdir webapp
    </code>

    <p>You can get to the Desktop (and anywhere else) from the <code>code</code> directory like this:</p>

    <code>
        cd ~/Desktop
    </code>

    <p>Remember our <em>home</em> directory from the very beginning? You can access that directory from any folder anywhere by <code>cd ~</code>.</p>

    <code>
      cp -rf /code/webapp /Desktop/webapp
    </code>

    <p><code>cp</code> stands for <em>copy</em>. Since we're copying a folder, we need to put the <code>-rf</code>.</p>

    <hr>

    <p>That's it for <em>Intro to the Command Line</em>. None of it is particularly complicated, it's just a matter of learning the commands and using them regularly. Learning the command line for me was how I started learning sass, git, grunt, and lots of other tools that took my web design to the next level.</p>

    <p><a href="http://jonibologna.com/command-line-primer-primer/" target="_blank">Joni Trythall</a> did a write-up on this too that I like and is worth looking over if you high-level reasoning for why the command line's great.</p>

    <p>If you've been working with the command line and are annoying that you can click and type, there are <a href="http://cmd.club/" target="_blank">commands for that</a>! I have these <a href="http://cmd.club/" target="_blank">bash stickers</a> that are pretty rad.</p>
