Dearest,

I think that people have children because our hearts grow. Remember when we first began dating, and our hearts felt ready to burst? Everything was wonderful and terrible at the same time. I didn't know that I could feel so much all at once. I felt simplified; a less complex being than I would like to be.

I think that we start to grow sad as we watch beauty happen. Life becomes calm; the calm saddens us. We end up wanting chaos to deaden the feeling of everything going right, smoothly, and want children to make things rocky again. And so they do, and so things become hectic for another two decades, and so you end up with calm again. A quiet peace that is confusing. What do we do with it?

I want to have kids with you, eventually, Brian. I'm not sure if that's madness or not. I guess because it delays sadness, but I'll know itâ€™s still right there waiting to rear its head and make us so, so sad.

With love always,
Helen
