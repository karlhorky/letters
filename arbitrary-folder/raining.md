Dearest,

It’s raining outside, and it’s entirely too hot in this café, and I’m angry because I haven’t had anything nice or interesting or insightful to say to you in weeks. Even after we went to my grandparents’ and took their plates and some art and it should have been macabre but it wasn’t just practical and even though we visited my grandfather and he was like an ornery ghost just bitter and angry about everything. A man who doesn’t want to haunt, and was scared of dying, and is now trying to die. 

And I’m hungry. Fuck this.

As always,
