A request:

"Dear Psycho Ex-Boyfriend,

I regret to inform you that it is at this point in time absolutely essential that I tell you go fuck yourself. There is no way around the matter; that is the here and there of it and I believe that it is best for my happiness (which I have come to understand, in my new-acquired wisdom, is much more important that yours) that you follow through on this request, post-haste, and with a certain degree of urgency. I expect to hear through close acquaintances of your fucking yourself (preferably in some sort of public venue) within the fortnight. This, I believe, is the least you can do for me, honestly.

There is also the additional question of what happens to our joint pet rock. As awkward as this is for the both of us I must insist that you take care of Rocky Rockwinkle from here on out, as it is too painful for me and I never truly forgave him for shitting on my pashmina that one time when we were in the Keys. It really was my favorite damn pashmina.

As for the large collection of decorative wooden ducks that we have acquired over the years, I will be keeping those. (To make sense of this more general trend, please see notes on "Happiness" above and consider it punishment for putting your sexual organs in places that were inappropriate to put them.)

With a beleaguered sense of duty before returning to my life a person-who-will-no-longer-put-up-with-this-bullshit,
â€”The wonderful, intelligent, lovely person who is now your ex"

Hope it helps, love.
