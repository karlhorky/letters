You,

I haven't been doing yoga long enough to have existential moments. I haven't been meditating long enough. I still feel a little childish and silly when I'm sitting in a dark room, trying to not think. Thoughts come unbidden and unstoppable and I'm always doing the opposite of what I'm supposed to, supposed to not think, and there I am, thinking.

I remembered how she had wanted me to go to Miss Porter's, and it made me happy that Caroline had gone. I apologized for all the times I felt like I was using her just to get clothing, or food, or things, while feeling ridiculous under a wet facecloth in a dark room full of other people trying to meditate on yoga mats, breathing quietly.

Before I had started sobbing, the instructor walking around created little buffs of fresh, clean, chilled air. I asked God if it was him, and ordered him to breathe on me again. It was teasing, and had hot air blown on me in response.

It was the first time in a long time (maybe ever?) that I felt like I was actually talking to someone.

With love,
Helen
