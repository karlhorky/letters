To whom it may concern at _Whiskey Drinkers Anonymous Incorporated_,

I notice that you are in need of a millennial for the position _Social Media Manager, $8/hr_ you have listed on your site. As a millennial myself I am highly qualified for the role and you would do well to hire me. To prove this I will make swag references and show you dope multimedia.

Attached is a photo of me holding a selfie stick. I, as a true-blooded millennial, understand how to operate one. As you can see in the photo, two people are not looking at the selfie stick. This is because they are not true millennials. Would you trust them running your social media accounts?? I hope not! I however am very qualified as I am very definitely a millennial. Please let me run your social media outlets.

Also attached is a photo of some coffee I drank once, but not before using Instagram to alert people that I was about to drink it. As a real millennial, I am an expert at taking perfectly poised photos of food to get internet "likes", or "hearts" with. This is another reason why I believe you should hire me to run your social media accounts. I will always put off bodily needs for the greater social good!

My third attachment is a Snapchat story from May 13th, 2015. It was a great day! Additionally, you will see that I am very able to make dope references. Without having me, a real millennial tweeting from your accounts, you will not know which emoticons to use! For example, key emotions are used because of a man I believe to be a rapper that all the kids—I mean other millennials like me!—like very much used key emoticons before his death on a jet ski. Key emoticons now mean, "We miss you, rapper with the key emoticons." Consider that one a freebie! Hire me to be your social media accounts manager, and believe me—there will be more where that came from!

I also encourage you to look at my tumblr site, infinite-tragedy-xoxo.tumblr.com, where I have a good following of 618 people. While I use this account to express my unique quirkiness with snippets of my upcoming Harry Potter fan fiction _L'Amor Interdit_, cool gifs and Alan Rickman quotes, it also shows my supreme social media management as a millennial. Did I mention that 618 people are following me?

I cannot wait to hear back from you about this incredible opportunity for the both of us.

Most sincerely,
@fan_cat_76
