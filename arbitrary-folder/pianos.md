Dearest,

Today I have spent most of my day moving. Either bouncing my leg, or shaking, or walking, or tapping my fingers. When I was a little girl and learning the piano I remembered that playing made me feel strange, like the musician was trying to tell me something benevolent but to me it felt like a possession I was violently trying to shake off. I tribute my no longer playing to this, laziness, and no longer owning a piano.

Human relationships are strange. No matter how amazing a person that you meet is, there is always a very real probability they will just fall off the map to you; keeping them in your thoughts and tweets and emails is hard, and unwieldy, and impractical. How do you suppose the president does it? I donâ€™t even want to imagine. Perhaps he has an assistant for maintaining relationships?

With love,

Helen
