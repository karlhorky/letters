The first two days without a phone my insides are jumpy and nauseated, a true withdrawl. My veins ache for information from the Internet, distrations from thought. I’m lonely. My neck, lungs, blood hurts like I’m getting a cold. The world happens without me because I’m exiled with no Wi-Fi. I wonder if my shoes have arrived yet. Maybe Lord is trying to reach me with news of his divorce. I have a parade of grostesque urges. I want to push little buttons quickly. I want information immediately. I want to post pictures of Ruth and me smiling into the sun. I want people to like me, like me, like me. I want to buy things without trying them on. I want to look at photos of drunk kids I knew back in high school. And I want it all in my hand. But my cyborg parts have been ripped out. What’s the temperature? I don’t know. What’s the capital of Hawaii? I don’t know anything. I don’t even know the automated systems in my body anymore. I don’t know how to be hungry, how to sleep, to breathe.

We keep walking. “Talk to me, Ruth.” I’m fraying.

Ruth says nothing.

What’s her problem? “What’s your problem, Ruth? If you don’t tell me, I’m going to think something awful. I’m going to think you got gang-raped or something.” 

Ruth keeps walking.
