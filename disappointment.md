Dearest, 

I am so disappointed in myself these days. For one, I have not written you much. I miss you, but only through a haze of disappointment. I don't know why I'm feeling this way. Itâ€™s related to my grandmother in some way that even I can't fully untangle. I loved her very much, so much, more than I can be honest with myself about. I will never see her ever again. I have not mourned.

With love,

Always,

Helen
