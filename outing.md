Dearest,

There was one time when I went with Baas to the mall. She drove.

When it came time to leave it was raining, and I had just learned how to drive stick, and in my desire to not let my grandmother get wet I said that I would drive home, and dashed out into the rain. It was raining quite hard.

I sat in the car for 10 minutes, stalling it time and time again, until in defeat I had to run back and admit that I had been unable to start it. I felt awful. I think she was a little disappointed too; not getting wet would have been nice.

This was one of the last normal outings we ever had. She lies on her deathbed now. She will never be well again.

Much love,
Helen
