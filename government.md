Dear ______, 

We are writing to inform you that from this day forth there will be no more roads. We as a government have decided that there are too many overhead costs to the whole thing and honestly we think driving is kind of _boring_, in this humble government’s opinion.

Should you wish to port your existing road service to another provider a few opinions are available. You are welcome to download your remaining road service by going to www.roads.government.com, signing in, clicking "Settings", navigating the ether, saying "I wish to see the unseen" into your computer mic (if you don't have one, don't worry. We’ll hear it anyway), navigating to "Road Data", and clicking the "Download Data in CSV" button.

While public roads will no longer be available henceforth, there are also a few propriety options available open to you. Apple has a $50/month "Limited Forever" plan that is lauded as "an option among evils" by the Opinions Daily newspaper. In addition Amazon has launched a $73/month "We Wanted to Get to Market Before Google" plan that many are dubious about after the failed Amazon phone from a few months ago but that Amazon Prime is just so _convenient_.

You will have 2 days to continue using roads until they disappear at 12 midnight and turn into government surveillance facilities in our ongoing war against spectral entities.

With little thought to the inconvenience of all of this,

Yours etc., 

The Government
